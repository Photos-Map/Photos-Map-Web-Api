## Generating keys

1. Generate public and private keys by running:

```
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out private.pem
openssl pkey -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```

It will create two files: `private.pem` and `public.pem`.

2. Now, run this to set the `private.pem` file as the environment variable `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`:

```
export JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=$(tr -d '\n' < private.pem)
```

3. Similarly, run this to set the `public.pem` file as the environment variable `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`:

```
export JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=$(tr -d '\n' < public.pem)
```
